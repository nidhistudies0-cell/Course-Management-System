Project Overview

The University Course & Enrollment Management System is a Python-based console application designed to manage university courses, their prerequisites, and student enrollment eligibility.
It ensures that course dependencies are valid (no circular prerequisites) and verifies whether students meet all prerequisite requirements before enrolling in a course.

Features

Add and remove university courses
Define prerequisites between courses
Prevent circular dependencies using cycle detection
Display full prerequisite chains (direct and indirect)
Check student enrollment eligibility
Menu-driven interactive interface
Handles invalid inputs safely
